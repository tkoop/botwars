<h3>The Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Players take turns rolling a die.</li>
<li>When it's a player's turn, he can roll as many times as he wants, collecting points (one point for each number shown on the die).</li>
<li>When he decides to quit rolling, all the points he rolled during that turn get added to his total.</li>
<li>But if he rolls a one, he gets no points for that turn and his turn is over.</li>
<li>The first person to 100 points wins.</li>
</ul>
